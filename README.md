# NotP - Minimalistic Programming Language

NotP is an experimental, minimalist programming language currently designed to support basic addition and print operations. The project aims to evolve into a full-featured language including variables, control flow, functions, and eventually a complete compiler and interpreter.

## Features

- Basic addition of integers
- Print statements
- Simple, clean syntax designed for bootstrapping further development

## Getting Started

To run a NotP program, execute the following command:

```
python main.py examples/example1.notp
```

## Example Program

```
print(5 + 3)
```

This example will output:

```
8
```

## Roadmap

Future development plans include:

- Adding variables and assignment operations
- Implementing conditional statements and loops
- Supporting function definitions and calls
- Building a complete compilation and interpretation pipeline
